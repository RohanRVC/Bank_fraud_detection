# Bank_fraud_detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. Utilizing a dataset with over 6 million entries, the model aims to provide insights and actionable plans to enhance fraud detection mechanisms.

## Objectives
Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity.
Develop and describe a comprehensive fraud detection model.
Select relevant variables for model inclusion based on thorough analysis.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and tools.
Identify key factors that predict fraudulent activity and assess their logical coherence.
Suggest preventive measures for infrastructure updates to mitigate fraud risk.
Propose methods to assess the effectiveness of implemented actions.
## Dataset
The dataset comprises 6362620 rows and 10 columns, detailing transactional information. A detailed data dictionary can be found [here (add link to data dictionary)].
